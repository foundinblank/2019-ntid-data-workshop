# Launch Into The Tidyverse! Reproducible Data Analysis in R :rocket:

## Objective
Scientists are increasingly required to make their data preparation, analysis, and statistics **reproducible**. :point_up: Reproducible resarch means anyone should be able to take your dataset and, using your analysis plan, arrive at exactly the same results as you did. That's good science! :raised_hands:

However, in the data analysis stage of a science project, preparing the data takes up 90% of the time. :scream: In this workshop, you will learn about how to do *reproducible* data preparation and analysis using [Rstudio](http://www.rstudio.com) and [the tidyverse](http://www.tidyverse.org). With these tools, you'll do better science :sunglasses:, save a lot of time :grin:, reduce errors :sweat_smile:, and even make some pretty graphs. :heart_eyes:

## Tentative Schedule
### Day 1: 2-Hour Workshop
1.  Introduction to reproducible data analysis and why scientists in every discipline need to engage in it
2. Rstudio & R projects
3. Data visualization with [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)

### Day 2: 2-Hour Workshop
1. Reproducible workflows
2. Manipulating and filtering data with [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/)
3. Tidying and reshaping data with [tidyr](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/)

### Days 3-5: Small Group Data Sprints
This is going to be cool! :tada: With your lab or research group and some data, we'll meet for one-hour intensive sessions where we'll review your research questions, data, and requirements. Then we'll put your newly-acquired reproducible data analysis skills to immediate use and do data preparation, analysis, visualization, or all of the above. Depending on how many groups there are, we might meet more than once.

## Frequently Asked Questions
* ANOVAs make my head hurt. Do I need to know how to do stats?
  * Nope! We won't discuss statistical testing in the workshops, but the datasets you've prepared using [Rstudio](http://www.rstudio.com) and [the tidyverse](http://www.tidyverse.org) will make your statistical testing easier to run and interpret. We can go over stats in the small group data sprints, though.

* I don't know how to code! Is that okay?
  * Coding experience is not required, but I'd recommend having at least some basic exposure to programming (e.g., setting variables, using functions). To get your feet wet, there's no better place to start than [Codecademy's (free!) Python course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python).

* What do I need to bring to the workshop? Do I need to install software on my laptop?
  * We're still hammering out the details, but you probably will be working off your laptop. A few weeks prior to the workshop, I'll upload installation instructions and some test code to make sure Rstudio and the tidyverse packages are configured correctly.

* What do I need for the small group data sprints?
  * Review with your lab or research group and decide what project you'd like to cover. Prior to the workshop, you'll submit your dataset and a description of which magic tricks :crystal_ball: you need to do on it. More information will be shared soon.

* I'm not a scientist or working in a research lab. Should this interest me?
  * :fist::punch::fist::punch:. If you're looking into data-oriented careers (e.g., data analyst, data scientist, or data engineer), the skills you learn here are highly desired in those jobs (one example - me!).

* What's the language of the workshop?
  * The workshop will be presented in ASL.

## Instructor: Adam Stone, PhD
I'm a deaf data scientist at [Convo](http://www.convorelay.com). I first cut my teeth on data programming and statistics while working on my Ph.D. in Educational Neuroscience at Gallaudet University. I used Matlab and R for my dissertation data analysis of infants' brain responses to visual linguistic and non-linguistic patterning. After that, I did a postdoc with Dr. Rain Bosworth at UCSD where I really dove into R 24/7, using it to analyze and report eye-tracking data of infants and adults watching sign language videos. At Convo, I still use R every day to do data analyses, and I've also branched out into SQL and building [data stacks](https://medium.com/@foundinblank/whats-a-data-stack-7c96f7a15fe8) to make sure all our data is flowing into the right places and is easily retrieved, understood, and interpreted by different business teams. I live in Edinburgh, Scotland, where my husband and I enjoy the great view of a 1,000-year-old castle from our kitchen window.
