# RStudio Setup

We're using [RStudio.cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/) - an instance of RStudio that runs entirely within your browser. It's like Google Docs, but for R! No installation needed. :sunglasses:

To set up:
1. Use the link I've emailed you. It starts with `https://rstudio.cloud/...`. 
2. Set up your RStudio Cloud account. 
3. You should be in a workspace named "NTID Data Science Workshop" with one project called "Workshop Setup." 
4. Click on the blue "Start" button to deploy and open the R project.
5. In the lower-right pane, click on `01_rstudio_setup.R`.
6. To make sure your R instance works, follow the instructions in that file.

*Or...you know, just watch the gif. Give it some time to load, it's a big baby :baby:.*
