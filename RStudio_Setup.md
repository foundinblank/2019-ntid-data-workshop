# RStudio Setup

We're using [RStudio.cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/) - an instance of RStudio that runs entirely within your browser. It's like Google Docs, but for R! No installation needed.

To get set up:
1. Use the link I've emailed you. It'll be in an email with subject "Adam Stone has invited you to join RStudio Cloud" and the link starts with `https://login.rstudio.cloud/invite?...`. 
2. Set up your RStudio Cloud account. 
3. You should be in a workspace named "NTID Data Science Workshop" with one project called "Workshop Materials." 
4. Click on the blue "Start" button to deploy and open the R project.
5. In the lower-right pane, click on `01_rstudio_setup.R` and follow the instructions in that file.

Or...you know, just look at the gif below:
