# RStudio Setup

We're using [RStudio.cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/) - an instance of RStudio that runs entirely within your browser. It's like Google Docs, but for R! No installation needed. :sunglasses:

To set up:
1. Use the link I've emailed you. It starts with `https://rstudio.cloud/...`. 
1. Set up your RStudio Cloud account. 
1. Log in. Look at the "Spaces" on the left. Click on "NTID Data Science Workshop"
1. Now you're in the NTID workspace. It should have one project called "Workshop Setup." 
1. Click on the blue "Start" button next to it to deploy and open the R project.
1. In the lower-right pane, click on `01_rstudio_setup.R`.
1. To make sure your R instance works, follow the instructions in that file.

*Or...you know, just watch the gif. Give it some time to load, it's a big baby :baby:.*
